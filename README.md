# Project Proposal

### Project title

ECheck

### What and why?

This semester I would like to work on building a web application that helps individuals and companies file their state and federal taxes. Businesses often write checks on a daily basis to their suppliers, but donâ€™t hold a record of them. This affects them during tax season, as they need to manually keep track of their checks when filing their taxes. ECheck is a tool to help file state and federal taxes as well as generate other business related reports. 

### For whom?

Although this software is mainly for accountants, companies with payroll, small businesses or middle level organizations, individuals who are idling for state/federal taxes can use it too. 

### How?

The web application will either allow one to make a business account or a personal account. Based on the type of account created, different features will be available at their disposal. For a personal account an individual can use the web app to file their state and federal taxes as well as have options to keep track of other personal finances. For a business account, the company/organization can do more than just filing for taxes, they can generate other financial reports (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement etc). The main goal here is to be able to provide a user-friendly interface to achieve the tasks previously stated. 

### Scope

This project contains many back end and front end components which I believe requires at least a group of 4-6 programmers. Although creating the two accounts (personal/business) might seem trivial, gathering data, possible web scraping, building a user-interface, and additional features to generate the reports we need is a lengthy process. However, with a whole group of programmers, the web app can be thoroughly built and additional aspects can be added.
